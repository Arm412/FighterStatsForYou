# Frontend (Angular)

This folder is intended to hold an Angular application.

Suggested quick start:

1. Install Angular CLI if you don't have it:

   npm install -g @angular/cli

2. Create a new Angular app inside this folder (this will overwrite files if present):

   ng new app --directory . --style=scss --routing

3. Run the dev server:

   ng serve --open

Notes:
- This scaffold intentionally leaves out generated app files. Use the Angular CLI to create a full app.
- You can move an existing Angular project here; ensure `angular.json` and `package.json` are present.
